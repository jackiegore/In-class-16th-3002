* define and compare/contrast temporal, rate, latency, synchronous, and phase codes
* temporal: The tmeporal code is the timing of spikes that carrys certain information in different patterns. Unlike rate codes and synchronous codes temporal codes rely on exact timing.

Rate: The rate codes carries information from the firing of the neurons at a specific rate that the strength of the signal relates to the amount of action potential. Unlike temporal coding this is a measure of overall amount of firing.

    latency: This is the delay between the stimulus and the start of a neuron firing response. Unlike temporal or rate coding this is specifically related to delays.
    synchronous: This is the fifirng patterns of multiple neurons at the same time unlike temporal or rate which is only one neuron. 
    phase codes: This is relative timing of the neuronal spikes within a cycle unlike temporal which is on it's on.
